            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the ſame reaſon ſhould mooue vs likeiwſe to keepe a cleare conſcience. And what is the cauſe that men liue in ſinne, and defile their bodies, with many thouſand filthy ſins? Surely, becauſe they thinke not of this day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they muſt ſtand before God. If they could but thinke of this day, that they muſt all come to a reckoning: O, it would ſtay and bridle their carnall hearts from many foule and filthie ſinnes, which novv they commit with greedineſſe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.3.</p>
                     <p>This will be a bleſſed day to all the children of God to heare the Iudge ſay vnto them, <hi>Come yee bleſſed.</hi> O happy day, O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed voyce.</p>

                     <p>But to the vngodlie ſinners that liue in ſinne, to the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, Blaſphemer, &amp;c. this will be a terrible and fearefull day, to heare the woefull voyce of the Iudge, <hi>Go yee curſed into &amp;c.</hi> Oh dolefull voyce, Oh heauie newes, O fearefull Sentence, O woe, and ten thouſand woes to all vngodly ſinners: woe then to the blaſphemer: woe to the drunkard, &amp;c. woe vnto all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and wretched ſinners: for there is no eſcaping of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. All muſt appeare, all muſt ſtand before God, all muſt come to their anſwere. None ſhall be ſo great to eſcape, or ſo ſmall to be forgotten. And then woe to them that ſhall riſe to this fearefull and woefull Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and heauy newes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Oh, it had beene good for ſuch men, if they had

For as God hath his Booke of infinite Knowledge, whereby he knoweth the ſinnes of all men and women as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as if they were written in a booke; and though men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them, yet the Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth them: So hee hath giuen vnto euerie man and woman a booke, their owne conſcience; wherein are written all our thoughts, words, and deedes, ſo as none ſhall eſcape. And the Bookes are two, the Booke of the Law, and the Book of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: the one ſhewing a man what he ſhould doe, the other what he hath done.

Surely, if there be any thing in a man to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed at, I muſt needs confeſſe that this is a wonderfull worke of God, that hee hath giuen to euery man and woman a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which is like vnto a booke; in which is recorded all our thoughts, words and works. A wicked man, an vnchaſte wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, how many thouſand vile &amp; filthy thoughts haue they in their mindes night and day? their hearts burne in luſt and in vncleanneſſe: now they paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to them, they regard them not, they make little or no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. But (alas) they are all written in this Booke of thy conſcience: thy conſcience
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:183907:41"/> markes them, thy conſcience writes them downe. And if thou repent not of them, and leaue them, O woe to thy ſoule, when <hi>theſe Bookes come to bee opened and read ouer.</hi> For then thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will accuſe and lay to thy charge, euery one of them in order. <hi>Thou haſt ſet my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds before me, and my ſecret ſins in the ſight of thy countenance,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid.</hi> Againe, in the heart of man, what anger, what enuy, what malice lurke therein? and they paſſe it ouer, and thinke it no matter. Well, know (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that vnleſſe you repent of the very thoughts of the hearts, euen theſe things will be found written in the bookes at the day of Iudgement; and what a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing will that be?</p>

What a number of wicked ſpeeches paſſe out of the mouth of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vaine men and women? what horrible and blaſphemous oathes? what curſed ſpeaking, lying, and ſlaundering? Now a wicked perſon, that thus abuſeth his tongue ſo many thouſand times in a day, he cannot for his life remember them. VVell, know that euerie ſinnefull word thou ſpeakeſt, is written in this booke, there it is recorded: and when this Booke of thy conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience ſhall be opened, it will diſcouer all thy ſinnes, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy filthy thoughts, but euery wicked word.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3 Our workes.</note>Thirdly, if we come vnto the liues of men and women, why (alas) they bee nothing almoſt but a continuall practiſe of ſin, as the ſinnes of mens liues they bee innumerable, euen as the Sands on the Sea ſhore. Now though mens liues abound with ſo many thouſand ſinnes, yet we ſee man perceiues not, nor

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> Fourthly, ſeeing the bookes muſt be opened, and euery mans conſcience muſt come to ſcanning; becauſe ſentence ſhall paſſe, and iudgement ſhall bee awarded accordyng to the things written in euery mans conſcience: How ſhould this cauſe vs all, both Miniſter and people, to labour to get a good conſcience?

Now if you aske, how is it poſſible to get a good conſcience? I anſwere, for the getting and keeping of faith and a good conſcience; we muſt

                     <hi>Sanctifie them by thy Trueth, Thy word is the Trueth.</hi> All graces of Gods ſpirit, are wrought by his word. But that wee may get a good conſcience, we muſt</p>
                  <p>Firſt, repent of all our ſinnes: wee muſt know by the Lawe of God, what is ſin, &amp; what is not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we muſt know the heauie curſe of GOD euen for ſinne, that the reward of ſinne is death eternall both of Bodie and Soule. For men doe by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bleſſe themſelues in their ſinnes; and though we heare of Gods Iudgements againſt ſin, yet whoſe heart is touched and troubled? Thus men runne on ſtill in ſinne, and feare nothing. They meane well they ſay, but yet liue ill, and thinke all is well.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, til we ſee what ſinne
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:183907:45"/> is, and then ſee the curſe of God due to ſinne, we ſhall neuer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly try our conſciences, and ſee how our ſins haue wounded them, that ſo we may repent vs of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we muſt be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for our ſinnes; wee muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe them, begging for pardon of them; and to hunger, and thirſt after Chriſt Ieſus: For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can purifie the conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, and quiet the heart, but onely the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt applied to our ſoules by Faith, with perſwaſion of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Marke heere then (beloued) when a man is thus humbled for his ſinnes, and beggeth the pardon of them earneſtly, with ſighes and groanes; then will the Lord ſend downe into his

                     <hi>whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne.</hi> Againe, though men ſee their ſinnes, and oftentimes their conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce checks them for ſins, yet how few doe bewaile their ſinnes? for I am perſwaded that there is not ſo wicked a ſinner, but ſometimes his conſcience checkes him. Indeede men ſee
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:183907:46"/> not the danger, and feele not the wounds of conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now their Bookes be claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, they be ſhut vp, their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Conſciences bee now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe: But the day will come that their Bookes muſt be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and their ſecrets declared; and then conſcience will accuſe them, condemne, and torment them.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath gotten a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo as being truely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their ſinnes, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging pardon, they finde ſome aſſurance of GODS loue in Chriſt, and that now their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences doe not accuſe them; euen then muſt men take no leſſe paines to keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a good conſcience, to do nothing to wound thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A mans Conſcience is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:183907:46"/> a very tender thing.<note place="margin">The meanes to keepe our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience pure.</note> It is like the apple of the eye; if it be prickt but with a pin, it will not onely blemiſh the eye, but endanger the ſight: So conſcience, it is a tender thing, if yee pricke it by ſinne, it wil blemiſh thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wound it, and euen make hauocke of thy ſoule. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Salomon, Counter-gard thy heart, &amp; watch ouer thy ſoule, Prouerbs</hi> 4.14. that thou do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may wound thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Now, that we may keep theſe books of account, (our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) pure and good, we muſt doo two things. Firſt, auoide all things that may any way hurt a good conſcience. Secondly, vſe all good meanes and helpes to cheriſh a good conſcience. In truth all ſin hinders a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Sinne is that vvhich
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:183907:47"/> wounds the Soule, and maketh hauocke of a good conſcience: that is the verie cut-throate of mens ſoules. And therefore, if you would keepe a good conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, take heede of ſin, which wounds a good conſcience, and makes it vnable to ſtand before God at the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>But there bee two eſpeciall lets and impediments of a good Conſcience: Firſt, ignorance of the Lawe, and the word of God. For when a man knowes not what is ſinne, and what not; how can he take heed leſt hee wound his Soule? And therefore wee ſee, let a man come into his Houſe at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, hee can ſee nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, and out of order; but let a man come in at Noone, then hee can eſpie the leaſt diſorder: euen ſo poore, blinde, ignorant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:183907:47"/> ſoules, not knowing the Law of God, cannot ſee any wounds in conſcience, nor nothing amiſſe in them. But let them come to the word of God, and looke in this Glaſſe, then they ſhall find themſelues much out of order; to haue wounded ſoules, and defiled conſciences.</p>
                  <p>The other impediment of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience is worldly luſt; namely, the loue and exceeding deſire of riches, honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, &amp;c. And hee that ſuffers theſe deſires to haue place in his heart, hee cannot poſſible keepe a good conſcience. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the meanes to preſerue and to keep a good conſcience be three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to doe all things that may ſaue and cheriſh true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, whereby our ſoules be aſſured of the loue of GOD
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:183907:48"/> in Chriſt Ieſu for the pardon of our ſins. For Faith is the root, and the foundation of a good conſcience; and without faith there can be no good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> Now to preſerue Faith, wee muſt often heare and reade the word of God, repent of our ſins, acknowledge and confeſſe them, and be humbled for them, and walke in the dueties of faith and repentance: And in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wee ſhall finde more and more the comfort of a good conſcience. And therefore wee muſt take heede we do nothing to break off the feeling of Gods loue, or to wound our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we muſt indeuour in all things to obey Gods will, and beare a conſtant purpoſe, not to ſin in anie thing. For, a purpoſe to liue in ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:183907:48"/> cannot ſtand together: ſo that where there is a purpoſe to liue in ſinne, there is neither faith, nor a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we muſt walke with God, as <hi>Henoch</hi> did, ſo to order our liues, as alwayes in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOD; and this will make vs keepe a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and the want of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men bold to ſinne, becauſe they conſider not that GOD ſeeth them, and that they haue a conſcience within them.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:183907:52"/> that our names be in Heauen: that wee are in the number of thoſe that ſhall be ſaued. And theſe are two moſt neceſſary &amp; fruitfull points to be knowne of all Chriſtians.</p>

The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdes, That no man can certainely know whether he be the childe of God, or no.

                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10 Iob 19. Rom. 8.16.

                     <p>Now then you ſee how little we are beholden to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hold, that we may not be certainely perſwaded of our ſaluation; but muſt onelie hope well. Did not <hi>Iob</hi> know it? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> know it?<note place="margin">Iob 19.

For what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can any Chriſtian haue, till hee know that he is the childe of God? How ſhould wee dare to call vpon God? How can we be at peace in our Soules?

                     <p>Secondly, now the next que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, How any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may come to this certayne knowledge, whether his name be written in this Booke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be the childe of God, or not? And this you ſee is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no ſmall moment, but a moſt weightie matter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes our ſoules very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and therefore let vs be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to liſten vnto it, that we be able to <hi>prooue our ſelues, whether we be in the faith, or not,</hi> whether we be the ſonnes of God, or nor; and ſo whether we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or not.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">By what means we may come vnto this knowlege.</note>Now there be two wayes to know it; One is by aſcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, into the priuy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>God.</hi> But this is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way, and not to be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any man, becauſe <hi>Secret things belong to God:</hi>

                     <p>Beſides this, there is yet an other way to know whether our names be written in the Booke of life; and that is by deſcending into our ſelues; and by certaine markes and teſtimonies in our owne hearts, to prooue that we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:183907:54"/> are in the number of <hi>Gods</hi> Elect. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro. 27.19</note> 
                        <hi>As water ſheweth face to face: Euen ſo the heart ſheweth man to man.</hi> Euen as a glaſſe ſheweth what a mans face is: ſo will a mans heart and conſcience ſhew what man is in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi> Then, if you would now know whether your names be written in the Booke of Life; that is, whether you bee the elect of <hi>God,</hi> and heires of eternall Life; you muſt now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your owne ſoules,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13</note>

The firſt marke whereby we may know whether we be elect or not, is the inward teſtimony and witneſſe of Gods ſpirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15</note> 
                        <hi>Yee haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe; but ye haue, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells vs, that wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinners, which haue not the ſpirit of God to guide them, but liue in ſinne; they haue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the ſpirit of Bondage, they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:183907:55"/> haue no tru peace in their ſouls: but they that be the children of God, haue the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ſeales vnto our harts the aſſurance of our adoption, and election, and doth make it knowne vnto vs, that we are the Sonnes of God: <hi>For his Spirit doth witneſſe to our ſpirits, that we are the Sonnes of God, Romans</hi> 8.16.</p>
                     <p>And, that no man might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue himſelfe, and thinke hee hath the teſtimonie of GODS Spirit, when hee hath it not: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth vs two moſt excellent notes, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee haue the teſtimonie of GODS Spirit, yea, or not. It maketh vs crie, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> Where the Spirit of God doth witneſſe to any mans ſoule that hee is the childe of God; It will make him cry to God, and euen
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:183907:56"/> fill heauen and earth, with cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and teares, with ſobbes and ſighes for the pardon of his ſins. And hee which hath not this in him, that hee cannot crie vnto GOD for pardon of his ſinnes; this man can not truely aſſure himſelfe that hee is the Childe of God. And though men ſay, they hope to be ſaued, yet (alas) they ſeldome or neuer pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for the pardon of their ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if wee finde the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of GODS Spirit, that wee are the children of God; It will make vs, not onely, to bee earneſt with God for pardon of our ſinnes, but it will make vs cry, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> that is, it will make vs beare the tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a duetifull childe, ſo as we ſhall be afraide to offend ſo louing a Father. And therefore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:183907:56"/> all thoſe which delight in ſinne, and are not afrayde to offend GOD: Surely, they can find no aſſurance, that they be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. And therefore, if you deſire to be aſſured that the names be in this Booke; labour to finde this teſtimony of Gods Spirit, to witneſſe vnto your Soules, that you belong vnto God, and labour to be earneſt in prayer vnto God, for that is a ſpeciall worke of Gods Spirit.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.12</note> The ſecond means whereby we may know, whether our names be written in the Booke of <hi>Life;</hi> is by the word of GOD. For, the word of God tells vs, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer beleeueth in Chriſt Ieſu, ſhall be ſaued. But the childe of God hearing this promiſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and applied, by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of Gods word, is able to ſay, I beleeue; and am able to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:183907:57"/> apply this promiſe to my ſelfe: For no man hath faith, but hee knoweth that hee hath it, and therefore can ſay, ſeeing I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue with all my heart, ſurely I know I ſhall be ſaued.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, beſides the bleſſed teſtimony of Gods Spirit, which cannot deceiue, and the witnes of the word of GOD; wee may know our election by the fruits, and effects thereof. As wee ſay a man is aliue, ſo long as we ſee him breathe; and can iudge of the Tree by the fruits: Euen ſo, by the effects of Election, wee may know whether our names be in the Booke of Life, or not. Now the fruites of Election bee ſet downe by the Holie-Ghoſt, that al men might be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and try themſelues, and know whether they bee orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Life, or not: <hi>Whom GOD
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:183907:57"/> predeſtinated,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.30</note> 
                        <hi>them alſo hee Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and whom he Called, them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he Iuſtified, and whom hee Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, them alſo he Glorified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where we may beholde the markes of our Election. For all that be elected to Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and bee written in this Booke; they are firſt called; ſecondly iuſtified; and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſanctified. So then, if you would know whether you bee elected to life, looke to theſe three effects of Election. Art thou Called? art thou Iuſtified? art thou ſanctified? Then ſure thou art Elected: But if thou haſt not theſe three, then canſt thou not aſſure thy ſelfe of thy ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>So then, the firſt fruite of our Election is our effectuall Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when as God doth, by the Preaching of the Goſpell, call
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:183907:58"/> vs out of the world; from our olde ſinnes, to be of the number of his people, to liue as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Againe, when a man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the preaching of the Word, to ſee his ſinnes, and Gods anger for them; diſlikes them, is grieued for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailes them, and begs the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for them, and beginnes to become a new man; to beleeue in Chriſt Ieſu, to ſeeke after Gods Kingdome: Hee which findeth this effectuall calling in him, he may aſſure his Soule, that hee is Predeſtinated to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life. But wee muſt take heed that wee deceiue not our ſelues with an outward calling, for our Sauiour ſaith;<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe heare the word of God with the eare: but wee muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to finde the Spirit of God
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:183907:58"/> to preach vnto our Soules; to applie the Word to our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to beleeue it, and to obey it. And therefore, they which liue in their old ſinnes, as blind, ignorant, and prophane, as euer before; (alas) how can they thinke to be ſaued? ſeeing God chooſes none, or ſaues not any, but whom he calles effectually by the Goſpel,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.13.</note> and ſeuers from the reſt of the world.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the fruit of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is Iuſtification: <hi>For whom he predeſtinated, them hee called:</hi> So then heere is an other token and marke, to know whether we be Elected, namely, or Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Now, this is an eſpeciall grace of God, to iuſtifie a poore ſinner that muſt be ſaued. And whoſoeuer is not iuſtified, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaued. Iuſtification hath two parts. Firſt, the pardon of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:183907:59"/> ſinne: ſecondly, the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe; For that, before a man can be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, hee muſt repent him of his ſinnes, know them, hate them, and begge the pardon of them; and then Chriſt Ieſus will aſſure vs of the pardon of them. And therefore, if wee would know whether we be iuſtified, or not, we muſt looke whether we haue truely repented, yea and haue beene truely humbled for our ſinnes, and got the pardon of them all. Secondly, that wee may bee truely iuſtified, wee muſt haue a true faith in Chriſt Ieſus; to lay hold vpon him, to be perſwaded and aſſured in our ſoules, that Chriſt died for me, ſhed his Bloud for me, obeyed the Law for me, and will couer all my ſinnes in his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. So then, marke the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:183907:59"/> where there is repentance, there is Remiſſion of ſinnes; where there is remiſſion of ſins, there is iuſtification; and where there is iuſtification, there is ſaluation. And on the contrarie parts; where there is no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there is no remiſſion of ſinnes; where there is no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, there is no iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and where there is no iuſtification, there is no ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O then what ſhall become of thoſe that liue in ſin, delight in ſin, and neuer (as yet) could ſhed one teare for their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and grieuous ſinnes? They can not finde themſelues to bee iuſtified; they can haue no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their ſinnes, ſo long as they liue in ſin. And therefore if you would knovv vvhether you ſhall be ſaued, or not: la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour firſt of all to repent, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:183907:60"/> to lay hold on Chriſt by Fayth, that ſo he may couer your ſins in his Bloud.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, fruite of Election is ſanctified. And this is a ſpeciall marke of Gods childe,<note place="margin">2 The. 2.13</note> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, to be ſanctified. Now Sanctification ſtandeth in two parts: firſt, they muſt dye vnto ſinne: ſecondly, they muſt riſe to righteouſneſſe. And would you know then aſſuredly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your names are written in the Booke of Life? Looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſoules. If you finde that you are ſanctified, if you hate your olde ſinnes, and filthie wayes; if you loue Vertues, and delight in all holy dueties; then it is a certaine token that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto God.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> For there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt. But if you do ſauour the things of the fleſh; lying in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:183907:60"/> the old ſins, Drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. why then certainely, you haue no aſſurance of ſaluation, that you can be ſaued: But you muſt needes ſing this dolefull Song, I know not what ſhall become of my poore Soule, whether I ſhall be ſaued or damned. Nay, if thou liue in ſinne, thou maiſt iuſtly feare that thou art a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of hell: For, <hi>Hee that is borne of God, ſinneth not:</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18. And, <hi>Let euery one that calles on the name of the Lord, depart from iniquity,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Thus to die to ſin, and to liue to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, is a ſure token that wee belong to God. Thus you ſee, how a man may come to know, whether hee be elected, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to Life, or not. Now let vs ſee what vſe ariſeth hence.</p>
                     <p>Seeing God hath his Booke <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> of Life, in which be written the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:183907:61"/> names of all thoſe that ſhall bee ſaued, and none of them ſhall periſh: hence cometh endleſſe comfort to all Gods children: If thou finde that thou art the childe of God, and thy name is written in Heauen, nothing can hurt thee, though thou bee poore, ſicke, full of ſores, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hated, contemned; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hurt thee. Nay, all the gates of Hell can not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt thee: no damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can come vnto thee. For if God do iuſtifie, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne? for at the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chriſt Ieſus will take his Booke of Life, and call vs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Come yee bleſſed:</hi> So as we ſhall not come to a terrible Iudgement, but to a louing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſeeing that it is ſo excellent a thing to haue our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:183907:61"/> names written in this Booke; to be the Elect childe of God; we ſhould labour for this aboue all things in the world; for without this, wee can haue no ſound comfort, either in life or death. And therefore our Sauior bids vs in the tenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> not to boaſt our ſelues of Learning, of Wiſedome, of Riches: whereas theſe are but vaine things; but to reioyce that our names bee written in heauen.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſeeing God hath a Booke of Life, and hath written downe the very names of euery man and woman, that ſhall be ſaued; and hath withall ſhewed vs the way that leads vnto Life; and vnleſſe we walk in this way, we can not come vnto it: It is our wiſedome to walke in the way that leades to Life, in the practiſe of Godlineſſe. VVee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:183907:62"/> are Veſſelles of Honour, and therefore muſt liue ſoberly, iuſtly, and godly, in this preſent world. Not to ſerue ſinne, and Sathan any longer: But as the redeemed of the Lord, to walke from ſtrength to ſtrength, from vertue to vertue, from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection to an other: till at length wee appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and there to reape the happie revvard; euen the ful fruition of all happineſſe, and that for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the Booke of Life, we haue heard already what is meant
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:183907:63"/> by it; namely, the Councell and Decree of GODS Election, whereby hee hath choſen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men and women from out of the lump of Mankinde, vpon whom hee will beſtow Eternall Life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee haue learned that a man may; nay euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man and woman ought to be aſſured, that his name is wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee did ſet downe ſome means out of the word of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16</note> whereby a true Chriſtian may be aſſured hee is elected; namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2</note>Firſt, the teſtimony of Gods Spirit, which cannot lie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the fruites and effects of Election; as Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Iuſtification, Sanctification, loue of the Brethren,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.14.</note> and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto all the Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:183907:63"/> of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſtands vs all in hand to labour for this aſſurance of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, elſe wee cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. and without it, wee can haue no true ioy vnto our ſoules. Surely, mens care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe in this poynt is great: Nay, their care to make their Lands and Leaſes ſure, will be a means to condemne them for their want of care in this point.</p>
                  <p>Now Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> proceedeth in the Deſcription of this laſt Iudgement,<note place="margin">After what maner all men ſhal be iudged</note> euen as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto him by the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelfe in a Viſion; and ſheweth after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ſhalbe all iudged, <hi>Euen according to thoſe things written in the Booke, according vnto our workes.</hi> You haue heard before, that hee ſaw all, both great and ſmall, ſtand before God; none
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:183907:64"/> ſhall bee wanting, or abſent themſelues. Now it might bee wondered how this great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſhall bee iudged; how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mans Booke ſhould bee read, and euerie mans cauſe ſhould bee tryed. For wee ſee what a long time it holdes our Iudges heere to trie a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; ſuch calling for Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſuch prouing of witneſſes, ſuch preferring of Inditements. But Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, It ſhall not bee ſo heere, for all muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the written Records: <hi>And according to theſe things which bee written in the Booke:</hi> So as when Chriſt Ieſus the great Iudge, ſhall once ſit vpon the Throne of his Glorie, attended by his holy Angells; then ſhall the Bookes of euerie mans conſcience bee opened, and then they ſhal afreſh call to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:183907:64"/> minde all their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue three ſpeciall points.<note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, who they are that muſt come to this Iudgement; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the dead, euen they which haue lien many thouſand years rotten in the graue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they muſt be tryed; euen by thoſe things which bee written and recorded in their Bookes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Touch-ſtone of this tryall; namely, the written word of God. And firſt of the perſons.</p>
                  <p>It is not to bee doubted but that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> meaneth that all muſt come to Iudgement, <hi>Both great and ſmall</hi> muſt ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. But why doth he ſay heere, <hi>And the dead ſhall bee iudged?</hi> It is to be obſerued that he names ſo expreſly the dead,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:183907:65"/> euen thoſe which haue lyen rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo many thouſand yeares, muſt come to Iudgement; they muſt be called to accompt; yea, their olde ſinnes muſt be now brought to light. For this is rhe wicked thoughts of many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, that when a man is dead, hee is well; then all his ſinnes die with him, hee is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and his ſinnes are not ſpoken of. But Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith heere, that euen the dead muſt come to iudgement; euen their olde ſinnes muſt come to light, and they muſt anſwer for them. It is nigh ſixe thouſand yeares ſince <hi>Caine</hi> ſlew his brother, yet this ſin of his is not forgotten; though <hi>Caine</hi> bee dead ſo long ſince, yet his ſins are not dead. No, no, <hi>Caine</hi> one day ſhall come to accompt for his ſinne. <hi>Iudas,</hi> he did for vile lucre ſell
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:183907:65"/> his Maiſter many hundreds of yeares agoe; hee is dead and gone: but at this day hee ſhall be called to accompt. So in our dayes, many men thinke, when they die, their ſins ſhall neuer be brought to light. The Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, hee getteth his goods by wicked and vngodly meanes, he groweth in wealth; when hee dieth, hee thinkes hee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heare of this ſinne agayne: So the Drunkard, Swearer, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faner of the Lords Sabboth, &amp;c. they are perſvvaded, that death will end all their miſerie. Ah (poore ſoules) it were well with them indeede, if death might end their wofull miſerie: But alas, alas, death is euen as a wide Gate, to let them haue ſome paſſage to endleſſe woe, and miſerie. For when they be dead and buried, their ſins doe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:183907:66"/> not die with them, their miſery is not then ended: O no, then begins their endleſſe miſerie &amp; torment: Oh it were good they might haue no more being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. It had beene good for ſuch men, they had neuer beene borne; or being borne, that they had been made rather a Toade, or a Serpent; for in death they haue an end. But it is not ſo with a filthy and and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinner. For when hee is dead and buried, euen then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes his greateſt woe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: for euen the ſinner that is dead a many thouſand yeares, muſt for all this come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore thou that liueſt in ſinne, in adultery, &amp;c. remember, that although thou die, yet thy ſinnes doe not die with thee: No, no, both thou and they muſt one day come to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:183907:66"/> iudgement: thy old ſinnes, and thoſe which thou haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſecret, they muſt come now to light.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that the dead muſt come to Iudgement, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>
                     </label> that haue laine a many hundred yeares in the graue, and then their old ſinnes, and ſecret ſinnes, muſt come to light: Oh let vs then watch ouer our liues, and haue this ſtill in our mindes. Well, though I die and rotte in the Graue, yet my ſinnes ſhall not die, my euill wayes cannot be buryed, they muſt come to light, that ſo wee may neuer dare to ſinne; thinking as many doe, that when they be once dead, they ſhall neuer come to accompt for their ſinnes. But Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth heere, that the dead were iudged, euen thoſe whom wee forgot, and whoſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:183907:67"/> ſinnes wee would thinke would neuer be called to accompt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen they muſt come to a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tells vs, how all men ſhall be tryed, and according to what, Sentence ſhall bee avvarded; Namely, according to thoſe things <hi>Written in their Bookes.</hi> Heere is the Euidence, heere is no witneſſe to bee produced; for a mans conſcience ſhall bee euen as good as a thouſand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Novv, what is heere meant by the bookes you haue heard already; namely, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conſcience of euerie man and woman. Thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the Booke; that is, the Euidence: No other witneſſe ſhall bee produced, but euen thy owne conſcience. Againe, the things which be written in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:183907:67"/> theſe Bookes, I told you they be all our thoughts, wordes, and workes; not onely our groſſe ſinnes, as murder, &amp;c. but in our Bookes bee recorded euen our idle and vaine words, euery vile and filthy thought; and by theſe Sentence muſt proceede; and according to theſe muſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be awarded.</p>
                  <p>Now then, thoſe which haue good thoughts, yea and holie things written in their Bookes, they be bleſſed and happie; for they ſhall not be aſhamed: nay, they ſhall be glad to haue their Bookes layd open, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, their faith, loue, zeale and patience, &amp;c. might bee knowne, and come to light. But woe then to all filthie ſinners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, &amp;c. For the reward of theſe ſinnes, is death, the wrath and curſe of God for euer.</p>

Alas, men thinke, thought is free, that they ſhall neuer be arraigned for their vile and vngodly thoughts. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.1.</note>

                  <p>Neither may we content our ſelues, to thinke we are in good caſe, if wee can ſay, I am no Drunkard, no Fornicator, &amp;c. No, looke to thy Booke, that there be not ſo much as an idle word written there: For euen they muſt come to Iudgement, as our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>I ſay vnto you, That for euery idle word men ſhall giue an accompt at the day of Iudgement.</hi>

There haue beene many thouſands which haue beene drowned in the Sea, and the fiſhes haue deuoured them; ſome haue beene ſlaine in the field, and the fowles haue eaten their fleſh, and many haue been burnt, and conſumed to aſhes. Then it is a very high poynt, a matter beyond all reaſon, that all the dead ſhould riſe againe. Men that haue beene drowned, fiſhes haue eaten them; &amp; men againe perhaps haue eaten the fiſhes; and they that haue beene burnt to aſhes, their aſhes haue beene ſcattered, who knoweth whither?

But, that the dead ſhall riſe againe, is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Faith, We beleeue the reſurrection of the dead: And ſo wee know it is a ſpeciall point of Gods glory, in mercie to reward his poore children; and in puniſhing in iudgement, the wicked and vngodly. But, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, In this Life all things happen alike, to the iuſt and vniuſt: Nay, oftentimes, <hi>Diues</hi> is full, and at eaſe, when <hi>Lazarus</hi> is empty, and in miſery. How then ſhould God bee iuſt, if hee ſhould ſuffer his poore children, that loue and feare his Name, heere to liue in miſerie, and neuer to reward them?

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:183907:77"/> eaſe, if there were not a time when they ſhould taſte of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? Therefore they muſt come to Iudgement, they muſt riſe againe, the godlie to bee made partakers of life, and ioy; and the wicked, of ſhame and confuſion: <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith in his nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, <hi>That though the wormes did eate his fleſh, yet hee ſhould beholde God with his eyes:</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth proue this with many reaſons: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>If the dead riſe not againe, then is not Chriſt riſen: And if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our Preaching vaine, &amp;c.</hi> And why ſhould we thinke it impoſſible for God to raiſe our bodies out of the duſt? Wee ſee a poore ignorant man is able of Aſhes, to make a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie beautiful Glaſſe. How much more then is the Euer-liuing, and almighty God, able to raiſe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:183907:78"/> our bodies out of the duſt? But you will ſay, are mens bodies eaten of fiſhes, men eate them againe? How is it poſſible to ſaue the bodies of men, thus conſumed to duſt, and mingled with the bodies of fiſhes and of beaſts? I anſwere, that though it be impoſſible to men, yet it is not impoſſible to God: For he that created all our bodies of nothing, can make them againe of ſomething; namely, of their owne matter; and to ſeuer their bodies from all other matters: As wee ſee that a Gold-ſmith can ſeuer one matter from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>So then this place doth proue and confirme that Article of our faith, that wee beleeue the Reſurrection of the dead. For howſoeuer a man dieth, by Sea, or by Land, in his bed, or in the

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:183907:81"/> ſoeuer men ſhall die; either by fire or water, or howſoeuer, they muſt one day come to iudgement: Let vs then beware of that vngodly thought, and diueliſh perſwaſion that runnes in moſt mens minds: namely, that thinke, that when they die, there is an end of all their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: And though they haue beene grieuous and horrible ſinners, yet if they can eſcape till death, all is well. And thus they thinke, that they and their ſinnes ſhall be buried together. No, no (poore ſoules) they doe much deceiue themſelues: Howſoeuer thou dieſt, thou ſhalt come to iudgement: And death is ſo farre from ending thy miſery, that it is a broade gate to let thee in into it.<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> For ſo ſoone as the Glutton died, hee was preſently in hel in torment:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:183907:81"/> And therefore let vs take heed how we wiſh, as fooliſh men do in their ſickneſſe, or age, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie; <hi>O I would I were dead, then I ſhould bee out of my paine.</hi> O no, no, if thou bee not the child of God, and a repentant ſinner; it had beene better for thee neuer to haue beene borne, or to bee a Toade, or Serpent. And thou ſhalt finde, that death is ſo farre from ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thy paine, that it ſhall bring thee ten thouſand times more paine and torment, euen in hell fire for euer: Therefore let vs not thinke that death ſhall end the miſeries of wicked men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſeeing all men muſt riſe to iudgement, and by what meanes ſoeuer they die they muſt bee called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; this is a wonderfull comfort to Gods poore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:183907:82"/> Who abides more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and griefe then they? Who be more hated, reuiled, croſſed, and wronged, then they? So as their life here, for the moſt part, is nothing elſe but a life of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie. But their comfort is heere in this, that they ſhall riſe againe, and then the caſe ſhall bee altered; then our miſerie ſhall bee turned into felicitie, ioy, and happineſſe. Haſt thou beene poore heere? then thou ſhalt bee rich, and poſſeſſe a Kingdome. Haſt thou beene hungry and thirſty heere? then thou ſhalt taſte of the Tree of Life. Haſt thou beene poore and naked heere? Then thou ſhalt bee cloathed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Robes of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe: and in ſteede of the rags of Infamie, and Reproch, which wee muſt put on heere,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:183907:82"/> wee ſhall bee crowned with a Crowne of immortall Glorie, &amp;c. Agayne, vnto the wicked and the vngodlie, it is not ſo with them, but they, hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their pleaſure here, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their portion in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, ſhall ariſe now to Iudgement, to heare the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them; and Mohammed Bouaziziow to bee caſt into the Lake that burnes with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone for euer,<note place="margin">Iohn 5.29.</note> which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſeeing Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that wee ſhall all come to iudgement; theſe bodies of ours, though they be drowned, though they be burnt to aſhes, or howſoeuer they bee conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet they ſhall riſe againe, eyther to Life eternall, or death eternall: Should not this make
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:183907:83"/> vs all (Beloued) to looke vnto our ſelues, to take heed we doe not vſe our bodies to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God. Wouldeſt thou haue thy bodie to bee partaker of Life, Felicitie, Glorie, and Saluation in heauen? Then vſe thy bodie now to the glorie of God vpon earth, to heare his word, to ſanctifie Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But if thou vſe thy bodie to ſinne, to ſwearing, to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whooredome, &amp;c. then know, that thy bodie ſhall riſe againe to iudgement to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for euer. Do not looke vpon the rich Glutton,<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> hee had abuſed his bodie to ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of it, was hee not feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tormented in Hell at laſt? And hee which had giuen his tongue to ſwearing, &amp;c. Now
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:183907:83"/> he cries, his tongue, his tongue. O that all ſinful wretches could but thinke of this one example of GODS iudgements! that if they abuſe their bodies as this man did, that they ſhall then taſte of the ſame Iudgement. Wouldeſt thou haue thy body glorified? then glorifie God in thy body. Doſt thou thinke that thy ſoule ſhall bee ſaued, and thy body glorified, if thou vſe the members thereof to ſinne, to vncleanenes? &amp;c. O no: let vs not deceiue our owne ſoules, it can not be. For, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.2.</note> 
                        <hi>How can wee that are dead to ſinne, yet liue therein?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, ſeeing the Holie-Ghoſt ſaith, that of what death ſoeuer wee doe die, wee ſhall all riſe againe; and Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they ſhall riſe to life, and to glory. This muſt teach vs all
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:183907:84"/> this Doctrine; namely, not to weepe and mourne immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly for our friends deceaſed. True it is, that CHRIST IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS wept for <hi>Lazarus;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 11.</note> and the Diſciples made great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> And ſo wee haue great cauſe to mourne and weepe, when as ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall member of the Church of God is taken away; we may not be as ſtockes or ſtones, or ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creatures, without affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It muſt needes grieue the heart of a husband to part with his louing, godly, and religious wife. But heere is a meane for this mourning to moderate our weeping, that wee weepe not and mourne not ouermuch, for they ſhall riſe againe. <hi>I would not haue you ignorant brethren, concerning thoſe that bee aſleepe, that you ſhould mourne at they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:183907:84"/> that haue no hope,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.13 Where the holy-Ghoſt tells vs, that the dead in Chriſt doe not die properly; but lay them downe to take a ſweet ſleepe, after their long and tedious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and troubls in this world; and afterward they muſt riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to life, to happineſſe, to liberty, to glory, and ſaluation. And wherefore then ſhould we mourne ſo exceſſiuely, &amp; weep, and lament at the death of our friends, ſeeing they doe not periſh, they are not caſt away? O no, their ſoules are preſently in ioy, and their bodies are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the graue, as in a bed of dowlne, to take a ſweet ſleepe till the day of Iudgement, and then they ſhall riſe to glory.</p>

                     <p>MArke, I pray you, how the holy Ghoſt repeates this point, againe and againe he beates vpon it, he can neuer haue done with it.

I anſwere, The cauſe is in vs, becauſe wee are hardly brought to beleeue this poynt, hardly perſwaded of ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a matter: for hardly one man of a thouſand beleeueth this;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:183907:85"/> That he ſhall be iudged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his workes: Oh it is a hard matter to perſwade men and women of this, That they muſt giue an accompt of their workes, and be iudged by their workes.

Doth their heart and ſoules euen erne in them? O no, no: they flatter themſelues with this conceit, <hi>God is mercifull:</hi> And thus they make the mercie of God a packe-horſe for all their abominations. And thus it is in the vile heart of man, to thinke he ſhall neuer come to account for his ſins, that he ſhall neuer bee called to a reckoning for them, and receiue his reward according to his workes.</p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:183907:86"/>
                     <p>Heere then we may perceiue there bee but two ſorts of men and women; there is the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinner, and the impenitent ſinner: and both of them muſt come to iudgement.

                     <p>Now the impenitent ſinner, is he or ſhee that liues in ſinne, and will not in any wiſe bee brought to leaue ſinne: They neuer with teares beg the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them at the handes of God, but wallow in all vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, heaping ſinne vpon ſinne, and one vngodly way vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: whereas all the ſinnes of GODS children, who doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, be quit and pardoned in

                     <p>And therefore we ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to abound in good works, in faith, knowledge, repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, loue, zeale, &amp;c. ſeeing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be according to our workes. But as for the vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinner that liues in ſinne, delights in ſinne, as they do; not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:183907:87"/> repent, nor haue no faith, nor good workes: euen ſo as their workes ſhall bee, ſo ſhall their puniſhment be. Ah what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full harueſt hath many a poore ſoule now to reape at this day, that all his life time hath ſold himſelfe vnto ſinne, that neuer had any care nor conſcience to liue a <hi>godly life?</hi> They ſhal weep, they ſhal howle &amp; lament, when they ſhal ſee their reward ſhall be according to their workes.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, heere by death and hell is meant, not death it ſelfe, or hell it ſelfe: but the heires of death and hell, that is, all the Reprobates that ſhall bee caſt into hell fire, and there die for euermore. Thus then you ſee what is heere meant by death and hell; namely, the heires of death, and fire-brands of hell: All reprobates, all impenitent ſinners that liue and die in their ſinnes, all thoſe ſhall be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lake of fire.</p>
                  <p>Seeing the holy-Ghoſt giues theſe Titles and Names, to all wicked and vngodly ſinners, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen death and hell. Surely this ſhewes the wonderfull miſerie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the curſed eſtate of thoſe

You do ſee the woefull miſerie of all impenitent ſinners; Namely, that they are no better then the veſſells of wrath, the heires of eternall death, and fire-brands of hell for euermore. O that all ſinners could forethinke of this wofull miſerie that hangs ouer their heades, What a ſtrange kinde of ſpeech is this, and of what force, when God calleth ſuch Reprobates euen death &amp; hell it ſelfe? Ah poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches! Ah miſerable and wofull creatures, which are but death and hell it ſelfe. Oh would that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:183907:91"/> the Drunkards, &amp;c. could lay this to heart: That howſoeuer they ſee not their miſery, nor the woefull eſtate wherein they liue, but bleſſe themſelues in their ſinnefull wayes; yet they are no better, then the heires of vengeance, and wrath of God; nay indeed, very death and hell it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that many wicked men doe, as the people did in <hi>Eſay</hi> his time;<note place="margin">Eſay 28.11</note> though they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in horrible ſinnes; yet they made a league with death, and were at an agreement with the Graue; they had taken a Leaſe of death and hell, to liue in ſin by Licence, without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the Lord tells them, he will breake their couenants, and diſannull their agreements: and although they haue liued a long time in ſinne, yet in the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:183907:91"/> end death will knocke at their doores, and he will lay hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and they muſt pay full deare for their long Leaſe; euen the loſſe of bodie and ſoule for euer.</p>
                  <p>And is not this the practiſe of moſt men and women? Doe they not euen make a couenant with death? and do they not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be at agreement with hell? Men liue in ſwearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. and yet they thinke they ſhal neuer die, they thinke they ſhall eſcape for all their ſinnes. But (poore ſoules) let them well know that death and hell will ſeize vppon them. Nay, if they liue and die in their ſinnes, without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; let them know, that they be not better then death and hel it ſelfe, and they muſt be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lake of fire.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:183907:92"/>
                  <p>True it is, you ſhall ſee many a notorious ſinner, contemner of the Word, a drunkard, &amp;c. they think themſelues to be iol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fellowes, and who but they? Alas, alas, their caſe is feareful: poore ſoules, they doe not ſee they be the ſonnes of death, the heires of vengeance, and the wrath of God, the fire-brands of hell; nay, euen death and hell it ſelfe.</p>

                  <p>Now, if a Blaſphemer, or an Adulterer, &amp;c. ſhould haue but this puniſhment, to holde his little Finger in the flame of a

                  <p>I will leaue the further hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:183907:94"/> of this poynt, vntill I come vnto the next verſe; where the holy-Ghoſt ſaith agayne, the better to make it ſinke into our verie hearts, That <hi>Whoſoeuer is not found written in the Booke of Life, ſhall be caſt into this lake of fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the better to expreſſe what is meant by this Lake of Fire: Not a bodily death, nor a materiall fire, like to ours; But the holy-Ghoſt meaneth heere, euen the ſecond death; that is, not of the bodie onelie,<note place="margin">Double death.</note> but of eternall death and damnation both of bodie and ſoule for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore. This is the ſecond death, and by this we may ſee there is a double death: there is the firſt death, and the ſecond death. The firſt death is, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the ſoule from the body, &amp; this is common to all;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:183907:95"/> the children of GOD doe die this death, aſwell as the wicked; yet there is a difference: For death is no curſe to the children of God, becauſe Chriſts death hath taken avvay the Sting of death, that it can not hurt the children of God: No, it is as a doore to let our ſoules into the Kingdome of Heauen: But the ſecond they neuer taſte of: No childe of God needes to feare the ſecond death;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                     <hi>For there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wherein the ſecond death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> Now, as the firſt death is onely the ſeperation of the ſoule from the body; ſo the ſecond death is a totall, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeperation of both ſoule and bodie from God for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And this ſecond death doth ſtand principally in theſe three points.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that all the wicked and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:183907:95"/> vngodly ſinners that liue and die in their ſinnes, they ſhall be ſeuered from the glorious and bleſſed preſence of GOD for euer: <hi>Which ſhalbe puniſhed with euerlaſting perdition from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glorie of his power,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9.

                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:183907:96"/>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the ſecond death ſtands in this, that wicked men and women ſhall not onelie be ſeuered in body and ſoule from the bleſſed and glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for euer: but they ſhall be <hi>caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> and haue all their abode with the diuels, and all the damned ſpirits in hell, where ſhall be no ioy, nor comfort, nor eaſe, but weeping, and wailing, and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of teeth. If a man ſhould be caſt into a deepe and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome dungeon, full of Toades and Serpents: what comfort I pray could he haue but to wiſh for death? This is the death that all the impenitent ſinners muſt die.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the third thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wherein this, ſecond death doth conſiſt, is, that all reprobates ſhall bee puniſhed with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting perdition; they ſhall bee tormented in body and ſoule with vnſpeakable torments: the wrath and vengeance of God ſhall ſeize vpon them, and feed on them, as fire doth on pitch, or brimſtone; where they ſhall bee euer burning and boyling, and yet neuer conſumed; euer in paine and torment, and neuer haue eaſe. And to ſhew the wonderfull torment of hell, of this ſecond death, our Sauiour compareth it vnto a furnace of fire.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.24</note> Now what a woefull tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it, to bee caſt into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of fire, and to lie many thouſand yeares therein? this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:183907:97"/> is a torment that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Againe, he ſaith, that <hi>Their worme ſh,ll not die,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 66.24</note> 
                     <hi>and their fire ſhall not bee quenched.</hi> Now how ſhould a man doe if hee ſhould haue a worme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes crawling in his belly, gnawing alwaies at his heart? This is the eſtate of all wicked men and women: They ſhall alwaies haue a worme, euen griefe and anguiſh of heart, euer gnawing at their hearts, and biting at their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And this worme ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer die, nor kill them, but euer gnawing and wounding them. So then you ſee by this which hath been ſpoken, what this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death is, and alſo wherein it doth conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Now all the Queſtion will be, Who ſhall be caſt into this Lake of Fire? VVho are they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:183907:97"/> that ſhall die this ſecond death,<note place="margin">Who they bee that ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſecond death.</note> which is ſuch a miſerable and wofull death? For there is no man nor woman that liueth, I thinke, but they ſuppoſe that they ſhall eſcape this death: they hope that they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ſo eſcape this flaming fire: And therefore now you ſhall ſee who they be, that ſhall be caſt into it. Looke, they are there marked out vnto vs, <hi>Reu.</hi> 21.8. <hi>The fearefull and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and abhominable, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and whooremongers, and ſorcerers, and lyars, &amp;c. ſhal haue their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death:</hi> So then rhe holy-Ghoſt telleth vs, that all impenitent ſinners ſhall bee damned,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10</note> ſhall be caſt into this lake of fire, which is the ſecond death.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:183907:98"/>
                  <p>Then what a ſtrange thing is this? The Holy-Ghoſt tells vs who ſhall be damned, and caſt into the Lake of Fire; all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners; the Blaſphemer, the Drunkard, &amp;c. and yet no man (almoſt) will beleeue this. Well, the Spirit of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie: He ſayth, That all the wicked and vngodlie ſinners ſhalbe caſt into the lake of Fire which is the ſecond death: now tell neuer ſo wicked a wretch of his ſinnes, of his ſwearing, &amp;c. And what will they ſay? Tuſh, <hi>GOD is mercifull, I hope I ſhall be ſaued:</hi> Is not this, I pray, to giue the Holy-Ghoſt the lie? Tell the drunkard or the profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Lords day, &amp;c. they ſhall be damned; doe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this? Oh, no, no; For if they did beleeue it, how durſt they be ſo bold to liue in ſinne?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:183907:98"/> Well, hovvſoeuer theſe vile wretches ſay, they hope to be ſaued aſwell as the beſt of them all; yet know, this is the truth of God; the holy-Ghoſt telleth vs plainly, That <hi>all vnbeleeuers, and theeues, and murderers, &amp;c. ſhall be caſt into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to you, whoſe hearts doe tremble for feare of theſe things, whoſe ſoules doe melt for feare of this ſecond death: now if you would know how to eſcape this Lake of Fire, and how to auoyde this ſecond death, which is th'eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and torment both of body and ſoule; you ſhall ſee how the Spirit of GOD doth not onelie ſhew you how to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape hell, but to come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; not onely to auoide dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:183907:99"/> in this Lake of fire, but to obtaine ſaluation and ioy in the bleſſed and glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Almightie God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore. Now ſee what the Holy-Ghoſt doth teach thee in the ſixth Verſe of this chapter, <hi>Bleſſed and holie is hee that hath his part in the firſt Reſurrection, for on ſuch the ſecond death ſhall haue no power: But they ſhall bee the Prieſts of God and of Chriſt, and ſhall raigne with him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, that is, for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, would you know what manner of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhall eſcape the ſecond death, and eternall damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this lake of hell fire? why the holy-Ghoſt ſaith, They, and none but they, that haue their partes in the firſt Reſurrection. So then it is manifeſt, in theſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:183907:99"/> words, that there be two reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and alſo a double death. The Children of GOD, they haue a double reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and one death. But all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly ſinners, they haue one reſurrection, and a double death. So then let vs ſee what is meant by this firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; namely, our riſing out of the graue of ſinne, to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life. This is the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,<note place="margin">Epheſ 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>You that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, hath hee quickned.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>So then, would you know, whether you ſhall eſcape eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fire in hell, euen this ſecond death? then looke vnto your owne ſoules. Are you dead to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:183907:100"/> all your old ſins, and new ſins? Are you quickned in the inner man? Do you hate ſinne as well when it is committed by your ſelfe, as by others? Doe you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to mortifie and to keepe vnder the workes of the fleſh, and walke in all holy duties and obedience both vnto God and men?<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                     <hi>For there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt, which walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bleſſed and holy are they that haue part in the firſt reſurrection;</hi> where he ſhews, that none ſhall be bleſſed, none ſhall haue part in the firſt reſurrection, and be freed from the ſecond death, but ſuch as be ſanctified to liue a godly life, that are partakers of the firſt reſurrection. And therefore, if you deſire to bee bleſſed, &amp; to eſcape the ſecond
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:183907:100"/> death, which is the euerlaſting damnation both of bodie and ſoule, then labour heere to liue a godly life. For theſe two, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Sanctification, cannot be ſeuered.</p>
                  <p>And this is a very great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all the true members of Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                     </label> that do repent and leaue their ſinnes, and liue a godlie life; though they be in miſerie, in pouertie, in want; and in the end, die the firſt death of the bodie; yet they ſhall bee freed from the ſecond death, that is, from eternall death: the gates of hell ſhal not preuaile againſt them. And therfore, as you loue your ſoules, as you deſire to be bleſſed, and to eſcape eternall damnation, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death: Labour (I ſay) to haue a part in the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to die vnto ſinne, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:183907:101"/> to liue in newneſſe of life.</p>
                  <p>But as for wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinners that liue in ſinne, delight in ſin, that haue no part in the firſt reſurrection: their caſe is wofull, they be ſubiect to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that is, eternall death and damnation: <hi>for if ye liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh,</hi>

                     <hi>ye ſhall die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore deceiue not your ſelues, as many do, which thinke, if they come to Church, heare the word, receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, all is well, they hope God will be mercifull to them, they hope they ſhall not bee damned. Well, marke what I ſay; thou maiſt come to church duly, thou maiſt heare the word of God as long as thou liueſt, thou maieſt receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as often as thou wilt; but if thou haue not thy part in the firſt reſurrection, that is, vnleſſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:183907:101"/> thou liue a godly life, vnleſſe thou mortifie thy filthy ſinnes, and vngodly deſires, vnleſſe thou become a new creature; ſurely, ſurely, thy eſtate is lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and thy part is in the lake of fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death. And therfore let no man deceiue himſelfe, and ſooth himſelfe, becauſe he heares the Word, profeſſes the Goſpel, receiues the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that therfore he is well enough. No, no: though thou heare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much, if thou liue in ſin, in ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. thy eſtate is as wofull as before, becauſe thou art not freed from the ſecond death.</p>
                  <p>And marke this difference, The children of God haue two reſurrections, and one death: they riſe from ſinne in this life, to newneſſe and holineſſe of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:183907:102"/> life: and they riſe at the laſt day to eternall life in Heauen; and therefore truely bleſſed. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, graceleſſe and godleſſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that haue two deaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and but one reſurrection; they die in ſinne here, they are dead in ſin, and delight in ſinne heere: and ſo they die the firſt death of the body, and eternall death, the ſecond death of body and ſoule in hell. And as they neuer had part in the firſt reſurrection: ſo the ſecond reſurrection is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to iudgement, to death, and to damnation.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, if you would liue when you bee dead, you muſt die to ſin whiles you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. Only the penitent ſinners ſhal liue for euer in eternal life; onely thoſe which die to ſinne, ſhall eſcape the ſecond death: But the impenitent ſinner, that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:183907:102"/> liues and delights in ſinne here, he ſhall die for his ſinnes eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; nay, hee ſhall neuer taſte of the life to come. But as hee would not labour to haue his part in the firſt reſurrection; ſo he ſhall be ſure to haue his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſecond death: which is ſo fearefull a thing, that it might make euen flintie hearts to breake in peeces, to lie in fire burning for euer, without anie eaſe, or end.

                     <p>THE former verſe did ſhew to vs, the execution of the laſt Iudgement vpon all wicked and vngodly ſinners; and of that we ſpoke the laſt time. Now in this Verſe wee may obſerue the different eſtate of the children of God, and of the wicked: for as there bee but two ſortes of men, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad, Elect</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, Penitent</hi> and <hi>Impenitent,</hi> the children of GOD, and the limbes of Sathan: So there bee but two places, <hi>Heauen</hi> and <hi>Hell, Ioy</hi> and <hi>Paine,</hi> the <hi>Right hand</hi> and the <hi>left:</hi> and the reward ſhall be according, either <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> or <hi>Curſed;</hi> for ſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith heere, <hi>The Elect ſhall haue
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:183907:103"/> eternall life: But they that be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, concerning the Elect, and thoſe that be choſen in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and whoſe names be written in Heauen. As their liues do differ from the wicked and vngodly; ſo their eſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life is farre different: for they ſhall be bleſſed for euer. And if you do aske, what is this Bleſſedneſſe that all the Elect ſhall haue? I anſwere with <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>The eye of man neuer ſaw it, nor it neuer entred into the heart of man to conceiue the hundreth part of this happines:</hi> yet we may out of the word of God, gather ſome taſte of it, as it is deſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the word of God.</p>
                     <p>And firſt &amp; formoſt, this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate of the godly at the laſt day, ſtands in this; That God
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:183907:104"/> ſhall be all in all vnto vs: what good thing ſoeuer the heart of man can wiſh,<note place="margin">1.

                     <p>Thirdly, all the Elect ſhall be like vnto Chriſt Ieſus: ſo
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:183907:104"/> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3.2.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Hee ſhall change our vile bodies, &amp; make them like his glorious body.</hi> Chriſt was moſt holy, pure, incorruptible, and glorious: euen ſo ſhall wee be; we ſhall be for euer freed from both ſinne, Sathan, death, and hell.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in heauen we ſhall reape endleſſe ioy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11</note> and ſhall delight in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God for euer: ſo as wee ſhall keepe a perpetuall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and reſt in the ſeruice and worſhip of God for euer. And this ſhall be done to all which feare GOD, and whoſe names bee vvritten in the Booke of Life.</p>
                     <p>O then, curſed be theſe men and women, which thinke, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                        </label> and ſay,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.14.</note> It is in vaine to ſerue the LORD. O no: then men ſhall know, it is not in vaine to ſerue
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:183907:105"/> the Lord: Nay, God will put a difference betweene them that ſerue him, and ſerue him not. And this ſhould encourage all men to labour to abound in all holy duties; ſeeing God will reward euen the leaſt worke of faith. If thou giue but a cup of cold water in the name of Chriſt, verily thou ſhalt not looſe thy reward. Though our workes cannot merite, yet hee will in mercy, for Chriſts ſake, thus Crowne the good workes of his children.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing a few ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ô let vs labour to be of the little Flocke; let vs, aboue all things, ſeeke this Kingdome of God: If thou winne this, thou art happy and bleſſed, though thou looſe all the world beſides. And if thou looſe it, thou art miſerable &amp; wretched, though
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:183907:105"/> thou winne the whole world: O then what mad men are we, if we doe neuer ſeeke for this, or dreame of heauen till wee haue one foot in hell: let vs not then thinke to gaine a kingdome ſo eaſily; we cannot go to heauen on beds of dowlne, but we muſt ſtriue to enter therein. And as life is ſweet, ioy, riches, honor, and pleaſures are ſweete: ſo to haue them for euer, without feare of looſing, this is a bleſſed thing: for ſo it is with them that bee in poſſeſſion of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they ſhall be out of feare to looſe it, but ſhall raigne with Chriſt for euermore.</p>
                     <p>Thus (in ſome ſort) you may conceiue the bleſſed, and moſt happy eſtate of all the elect and faithfull children of Almightie God, which ought to moue vs to repent and turne to God.</p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:183907:106"/>
                     <p>But, what ſhall become of the reſt, the vngodly ſinners, of them whoſe names be not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Booke of Life? Alas poore wretches, poore ſoules! it grieues me to think of them, it would make a mans heart to melt, to thinke on their moſt wofull miſerie: And I quake to ſpeake, or to thinke what ſhall become of their ſoules for euer. The Holy-Ghoſt ſaith heere, <hi>They ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> What ſhall become then of the ſwearer, drunkard? &amp;c. They ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire:<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> for ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Goe ye curſed, &amp;c.</hi> This is their end, and this is their portion for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore. Ah poore wretch, Ah vile creature, ah miſerable ſinner: it had beene good for them, if they had neuer beene borne, or beene made rather
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:183907:106"/> Toads, or Serpents, then Men. For beſides that, that they ſhall be caſt out of the glorious and comfortable preſence of God, and his holy Angels, they ſhal be caſt into this lake of fire for euer.</p>
                     <p>Concerning which Lake of fire, into which all impenitent and hard-hearted ſinners ſhall be caſt for euer; I will ſet downe three ſpeciall points.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the perpetuitie of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the extreamitie of it.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, that it is reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſſe.</p>
                     <p>All which conſidered; mee thinks it ſhould make the flinty hearts of ſinners to melt, and to breake in peeces, for feare they doe come into this place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into this lake of fire.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing the ſpirit of God
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:183907:107"/> doth repeate it againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that all reprobate ſinners ſhal be caſt into the lake of fire; it is to ſhew, that men doe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſider of that, they doe not tremble at it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beates vpon it, to teach vs, it is a ſpeciall poynt to bee thoght on, to mollifie our hard hearts.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, concerning this lake of fire: In that it is named heere <hi>A lake of fire,</hi> this noteth to vs, the extremitie of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is a place of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe woe, vnſpeakeable paine. The Scripture giues it ſundrie names, to ſet forth the vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torment thereof.<note place="margin">Reu. 21.8.</note> 
                        <hi>All wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; impenitent ſinners ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> For of all torments, none is ſo extreme as fire. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>There ſhal be weeping,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 13.28</note> 
                        <hi>wayling, &amp;c.</hi> And it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:183907:107"/> ſhalbe moſt hot, and yet moſt colde; ſtrangeneſſe of this fire, &amp;c. Againe, <hi>Their worme ſhall neuer die, Marke chap.</hi> 9.44. That worme which ſhall gnaw their conſciences, euen the torment of their conſciences. O what a wofull thing is this, for a man or woman, to haue a worme continually to gnaw their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels within, neuer to let them alone, or to giue them any reſt? Such ſhall the miſery be of the wicked. Againe, <hi>Tophet is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the King, hee cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and it is deepe and large, and the burning therof is fire &amp; much wood, and the breath of the Lord as a riuer of brimſtone ſhall kindle it, Eſay</hi> 30.33. So as the wrath of the Lord ſhall be as bellows to blow it, and as a riuer of brimſtone to maintaine it.</p>
                     <p>By this you may alittle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:183907:108"/> the extreamitie of this wofull Lake of hel fire. But if I had the tongue of men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, I could neuer expreſſe it to the full. For as the ioyes of heauen be vnſpeakeable, ſo the torments of hell can not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, at what time the totall wrath of God ſhall ſeize vppon the reprobates, both body and ſoule, and ſhall feed vpon them for euermore. Now, to the end you may the better conceiue the extreamitie of it, you muſt know, that the torments of hel, they be vniuerſal euen in all the parts of the bodie, and faculties of the ſoule at once; the mind, the wil, the conſcience, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the head, the heart, &amp;c. all at once ſhall be tormented. The paines in this life, they are (for the moſt part) particular in ſome part of the body: but in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:183907:108"/> this fire, the ſinner ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in all parts at once: and yet we may ſee, that ſome pains there be, as is the ſtone, &amp;c. which men would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue for a whole world. Alas, what a woefull thing will this be, to be thus tormented, euen in all and euerie member ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly? Let one example ſerue in this point. The rich Glutton cries out, <hi>Oh I am tormented in this flame! Luk.</hi> 16. The torment and heate was ſo great, that hee would haue giuen euen a whole world, if he had beene Lord of it, for ſo much water as would haue ſtucke to ones finger, to haue cooled his flaming tong: Tongue, tongue; Soule, ſoule: Thus you ſee, that this fire is moſt extreame and wofull, and yet men wil not beleeue it, they feare it not.</p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:183907:109"/>
                     <p>But let vs thinke vppon the moſt wofull and extreme paine of this Lake of fire, and let vs make that vſe which CHRIST teacheth vs: <hi>If thy right hand or foote,</hi> that is, anie thing neuer ſo ſweete, neuer ſo profitable, neuer ſo deere or neere vnto vs; <hi>Let vs cut them off and caſt them from vs;</hi> that is, let vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, and forſake them all: For it is better to goe poore to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then rich to hell: It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to goe naked to Heauen, then in coſtly apparell to Hell. O let all carnall men, all vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinners, that liue in pleaſures, ſports or paſtimes; yea let them know they ſhall pay full deerely for theſe things, euen the loſſe of their ſoules in hell for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as the paines of Hell be eaſeleſſe and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:183907:109"/> ſo they be endleſſe and perpetuall, no end of them for euermore. So <hi>Abraham</hi> tels the rich Glutton; <hi>You that bee there cannot come hither, Luke</hi> 16. and ſo ſayth S. <hi>Iohn, Reuel.</hi> 21. <hi>It is a lake of fire &amp; brimſtone that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for euer.</hi> So, <hi>Go ye curſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerlaſting fire, Mat.</hi> 25.41. It can neuer be quenched, when as damned ſinners ſhal lie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many thouſand yeares, yea, as many as there be Starres in Heauen, and yet neuer to haue an end. If a man ſhould but once euerie thouſand yeares, take one ſpoonfull of water out of the Sea; how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand yeares would be expired before he ſhould haue emptied the ſame?</p>
                     <p>O conſider this, you that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get GOD; Conſider this, you which contemne the Word of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:183907:110"/> GOD, profane the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, that make no conſcience at all of drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. what a treaſure of plagues the Lord hath reſerued for the damned? Oh, let vs thinke often of this, that theſe torments bee both endleſſe and eaſeleſſe? Oh what madde men and women, what fooles be wee, if wee will now enioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon, and then to lie in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for euer? What ſhall it benefite or profite vs to enioy a litle worldly pelfe, mony, lands or liuings heere, to liue in all pleaſures &amp; delights, ſome ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or eightie yeares, and then to be tormented in hell fire for euermore. And yet doe we ſee that ſuch is the extreame follie, and madnes of many men, that they will haue their penyworths heere, though they pay neuer
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:183907:110"/> ſo deare for it in the life which is to come.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, theſe torments, as they be endleſſe and eaſeleſſe, ſo they be remedileſſe. This we may beholde in the Glutton in hell, who would haue giuen a world, if hee had beene owner of it, and yet for all that could he not haue it; it was then deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. For there is no eaſe nor remedy: in hell no redemption after death; no ſiluer nor golde, no witte, nor policie, no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to another Iudge; but hee muſt lie by it for euermore euen in this cloſe priſon, till he haue paid the debt and vttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For, if all the Saints and Angells in the Kingdome of heauen ſhould fall at the feete of Chriſt, to begge but for one ſoule, it could do him no good, CHRIST would deny them al,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:183907:111"/> they muſt haue the repulſe.</p>
                     <p>O conſider this: this is it that ought to make all men to quake, and all hearts to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in hell is no eaſe, nor hope of redemption. This is that which makes the deuils and damned ſpirits to feare and to tremble, and yet it cannot moue flintie, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie-hearted ſinners once to be afraid. O I beſeech you let vs thinke of theſe things now in theſe daies of mercie: now is remedie to bee had, now wee may auoide this woefull miſerie, now wee may eſcape this fearefull torment. If wee will now repent, if we will now leaue our ſinnes and begge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of almighty God for them, we may eſcape: but after death there is no time of mercie but iudgement and torment,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:183907:111"/> but fire, and brimſtone, and the wrath of God for euermore. And therefore now let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, let vs bewaile our ſinnes, and liue as the ſeruants of God, and not as the ſlaues of ſinne and Sathan, any longer; and then the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt vs.</p>
                     <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt tels vs,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.26</note> that the ſoule of a poore begger is more worth then many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds: And therefore the loſſe of a ſoule is greater then the loſſe of the whole world.</p>
                     <p>If a man ſhould looſe Houſe, Land, Wife, Childe, and all hee hath, yet it is nothing in compariſon of his ſoule: that is a loſſe of all loſſes, to bee ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from God, and from Chriſt, and to bee in hell torments for euer. O then let vs know what our ſoules bee worth; let vs
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:183907:112"/> learne to prize them aboue the whole world. But alas, men can not ſo eſteeme of them. Oh no: men will for one penny, or an houres pleaſure, hazard loſſe of ſoule and bodie for euermore. Ah poore ſoule, thou didſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet know what thy ſoule is worth. Chriſt Ieſus ſayth, it is more worth then all the world. Oh let vs ſo eſteeme of it, and value it, and account all riches, pleaſures, or profites, as dung, ſo that our ſoules, our poore ſoules may be ſaued in the day of our Lord.</p>

                  <p>Touching the order of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this Booke, wherein king <hi>Salomon</hi> labours to build vp the Spirituall Temple of the Soule: It is the ſame hee obſerued in building the materiall temple,<note place="margin">1. Reg 6.</note> where he framed three Courts; the vtmoſt for the Common People, the ſecond for the Prieſts and Leuites, and laſt of all, that <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> the Holieſt of Holies, onelie for the High Prieſt to enter in at, and that but once a yeare: euen ſo in this Spirituall Temple of mans Soule hee hath likewiſe framed three Courts: Firſt, an
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:183907:124"/> vtmoſt Court, which is his Booke of <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> where all ſorts and degrees of men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, are taught &amp; inſtructed a ciuill courſe of maners: Next to that, he hath a ſecond Court, which is his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> leading men on further in the wayes of godlineſſe and Chriſtian piety: And laſt of all, hee hath a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Sanctorum,</hi> which is his <hi>Canticles,</hi> wherein not euerie one, but onely thoſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in heauenlie and Diuine Myſteries may behold the pure, free, perfect, eternall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant loue of Chriſt Ieſus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church, and euerie faithfull Soule; as alſo the loue of his Church towardes him, and what great and princely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits ſhe reapeth by him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the Title and ſubiect matter of this moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:183907:125"/> Booke, as there is <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum Sabbati,</hi> ſo this is a <hi>Song of Songs:</hi> becauſe of all that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> did endite, this is moſt Diuine and moſt excellent. In the which hee doth moſt liuely and affectionately, by Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, and Parabolicall Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, cipher out and deſcribe vnto vs the moſt holie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue of Chriſt Ieſus, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Church his bleſſed Spouſe. For CHRIST and his Church are heere brought in, in this worthie Booke, as two Paramours,<note place="margin">Pſalme 45</note> who are in loue the one with the other; as a time of wooing euer goeth before the ſolemnization of Matrimonie, and which in due conuenient time haue a purpoſe to marrie,<note place="margin">Math. 1.11</note> as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed before they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So the ſame order is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:183907:125"/> in this Spirituall Vnion betwixt Chriſt and his Church: <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.29. They muſt firſt bee contracted, then after married. The Contract is, when a man is regenerate and borne anew, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi> 21 9. tranſlated out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into Grace, depending on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon Chriſt for ſaluation: and finiſhed and made vp in the day of Iudgement, when all the Elect ſhall fully enioy Chriſt. For ſo witneſſeth the Holy ghoſt, where it is ſaid, <hi>Let all be glad and reioyce, and giue glory to him, for the Marriage of the Lambe is come, and his wife hath made herſelfe ready, Reu.</hi> 19.7. So then this booke containes in it the wonderfull loue, and mutual affection betwixt Chriſt Ieſus and his Spouſe: the true Church of GOD, and euerie true beleeuer. Thus much may
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:183907:126"/> ſerue touching the book it ſelf, we will now come to the words of the Text.</p>

                     <p>In the third Verſe ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth her vntowardneſſe, and her want of power to embrace Chriſt, and therefore ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him to draw her heart by
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:183907:126"/> his Word and Spirit: whereby ſhee ſheweth her earneſt deſire to receiue Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

To this ſhe confeſſeth, that though by Nature ſhee be blacke, ful of blemiſhes and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruptions, by reaſon of her originall ſinne, and naturall corruptions, as alſo her actuall tranſgreſſions; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, being waſhed in Chriſts Bloud, cloathed in his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and being decked and beautified vvith the Graces of his Spirit, Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Zeale, Patience,

                     <p>Now in the ſixt Verſe, ſhee puts vp an earneſt requeſt vnto Chriſt, that he would in mercie ſhew her where hee feedeth his Flocke, and where he prouides comfort for them in the time of trouble.

Firſt then, ſeeing that Chriſt will thus paſſe by the ſinnes of his children, and iudge them faire, without any ſpot and blemiſh of ſinne, if they do truely repent, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Him, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by faith; Here is matter of endleſſe comfort to euerie poore childe of God.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Doeſt thou repent of thy ſinnes, and art truely humbled for them?

Wicked men, falſe teachers, lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſet ſuch a face and ſhew on their errors, and beare them out with ſuch a countenance, credite, and authoritie: and the truth is ſo neglected, plaine, and

So when <hi>Michaiah</hi> told the trueth, and <hi>Ahab</hi> had foure hundred falſe Prophets, it was hatd to diſcerne the truth of God from the lying of Sathan. In Chriſts time, how did the Scribes and Phariſees confound Religion, dimme and dazell the truth; for the which, our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did often reprooue them? And in our times, how doe the Papiſts labour to obſcure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? how bold and impudent are they, to defend Idolatrie,

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to intreate the Lord in all humilitie, to open our eyes to diſcerne the truth; to giue vs his holie Spirit, to leade vs into all truth, to giue vnto vs the Spirit of Diſcerning, to trie the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the doctrine, whether it be of God, or not: for otherwiſe we may be ledde awry, and take light for darkeneſſe, and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for light.
