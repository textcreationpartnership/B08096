            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Now, that we may keep the≈øe books of account, (our con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) pure and good, we mu≈øt doo two things. Fir≈øt, auoide all things that may any way hurt a good con≈øcience. Secondly, v≈øe all good meanes and helpes to cheri≈øh a good con≈øcience. In truth all ≈øin hinders a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience. Sinne is that vvhich
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:183907:47"/> wounds the Soule, and maketh hauocke of a good con≈øcience: that is the verie cut-throate of mens ≈øoules. And therefore, if you would keepe a good con≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, take heede of ≈øin, which wounds a good con≈øcience, and makes it vnable to ≈øtand before God at the la≈øt day.</p>
                  <p>But there bee two e≈øpeciall lets and impediments of a good Con≈øcience: Fir≈øt, ignorance of the Lawe, and the word of God. For when a man knowes not what is ≈øinne, and what not; how can he take heed le≈øt hee wound his Soule? And therefore wee ≈øee, let a man come into his Hou≈øe at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, hee can ≈øee nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øe, and out of order; but let a man come in at Noone, then hee can e≈øpie the lea≈øt di≈øorder: euen ≈øo poore, blinde, ignorant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:183907:47"/> ≈øoules, not knowing the Law of God, cannot ≈øee any wounds in con≈øcience, nor nothing ami≈ø≈øe in them. But let them come to the word of God, and looke in this Gla≈ø≈øe, then they ≈øhall find them≈øelues much out of order; to haue wounded ≈øoules, and defiled con≈øciences.</p>
                  <p>The other impediment of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øcience is worldly lu≈øt; namely, the loue and exceeding de≈øire of riches, honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, &amp;c. And hee that ≈øuffers the≈øe de≈øires to haue place in his heart, hee cannot po≈ø≈øible keepe a good con≈øcience. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the meanes to pre≈øerue and to keep a good con≈øcience be three.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, to doe all things that may ≈øaue and cheri≈øh true ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, whereby our ≈øoules be a≈ø≈øured of the loue of GOD
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:183907:48"/> in Chri≈øt Ie≈øu for the pardon of our ≈øins. For Faith is the root, and the foundation of a good con≈øcience; and without faith there can be no good con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> Now to pre≈øerue Faith, wee mu≈øt often heare and reade the word of God, repent of our ≈øins, acknowledge and confe≈ø≈øe them, and be humbled for them, and walke in the dueties of faith and repentance: And in ≈øo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wee ≈øhall finde more and more the comfort of a good con≈øcience. And therefore wee mu≈øt take heede we do nothing to break off the feeling of Gods loue, or to wound our con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we mu≈øt indeuour in all things to obey Gods will, and beare a con≈øtant purpo≈øe, not to ≈øin in anie thing. For, a purpo≈øe to liue in ≈øin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:183907:48"/> cannot ≈øtand together: ≈øo that where there is a purpo≈øe to liue in ≈øinne, there is neither faith, nor a good con≈øcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we mu≈øt walke with God, as <hi>Henoch</hi> did, ≈øo to order our liues, as alwayes in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of GOD; and this will make vs keepe a good Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and the want of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men bold to ≈øinne, becau≈øe they con≈øider not that GOD ≈øeeth them, and that they haue a con≈øcience within them.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:183907:52"/> that our names be in Heauen: that wee are in the number of tho≈øe that ≈øhall be ≈øaued. And the≈øe are two mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary &amp; fruitfull points to be knowne of all Chri≈øtians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Whether it be po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the childe of God to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his name be written in this booke of Life.</note>Concerning the fir≈øt point, whether it bee po≈ø≈øible for the child of God to know whether his name be written in the book of Life, or not. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdes, That no man can certainely know whether he be the childe of God, or no. Nay, they condemne this as a foule fault, and bolde pre≈øumption, for any man to be certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded of this, That hee is the child of God, elected in Chri≈øt Ie≈øu; and that his name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Booke of Life. They ≈øay, wee are to hope well, &amp;c. But (alas) ≈øhall we venture the ≈øaluation of our ≈øoules vpon an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:183907:52"/> vncertaine hope? No, we mu≈øt go further, and labour to be a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured, and certainly per≈øwaded of this, That our Names are written in the book of Life: and that a true Chri≈øtian, man or woman, may a≈ø≈øuredly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded, &amp; certainely know, that he is the childe of God, it is out of que≈øtion, if we will beleeue the holy-gho≈øt. El≈øe why ≈øhould S. <hi>Peter</hi> will vs to giue all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence <hi>to make our Election ≈øure?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10 Iob 19. Rom. 8.16. Luke 10.</note> And why did our Sauiour bid his Di≈øciples <hi>Reioyce that their Names were written in the booke of Life,</hi> if they could not know it? Againe, euery Article of our Chri≈øtian faith doeth confirme the trueth of this Doctrine; where we are taught to beleeue the Catholique Church; and that wee are of the number of Gods people. We beleeue the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:183907:53"/> pardon of our ≈øinnes, and that wee ≈øhall haue life euerla≈øting.</p>
                     <p>Now then you ≈øee how little we are beholden to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hold, that we may not be certainely per≈øwaded of our ≈øaluation; but mu≈øt onelie hope well.

For what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can any Chri≈øtian haue, till hee know that he is the childe of God? How ≈øhould wee dare to call vpon God? How can we be at peace in our Soules? With what comfort can we performe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:183907:53"/> obedience vnto GOD, except we finde this ble≈ø≈øed per≈øwa≈øion, that our names are in this book; and that wee be the Elect and cho≈øen of God?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, now the next que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion is, How any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may come to this certayne knowledge, whether his name be written in this Booke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be the childe of God, or not? And this you ≈øee is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no ≈ømall moment, but a mo≈øt weightie matter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes our ≈øoules very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and therefore let vs be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to li≈øten vnto it, that we be able to <hi>prooue our ≈øelues, whether we be in the faith, or not,</hi> whether we be the ≈øonnes of God, or nor; and ≈øo whether we ≈øhall be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or not.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">By what means we may come vnto this knowlege.</note>Now there be two wayes to know it; One is by a≈øcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, into the priuy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>God.</hi> But this is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way, and not to be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any man, becau≈øe <hi>Secret things belong to God:</hi>

                     <p>Be≈øides this, there is yet an other way to know whether our names be written in the Booke of life; and that is by de≈øcending into our ≈øelues; and by certaine markes and te≈øtimonies in our owne hearts, to prooue that we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:183907:54"/> are in the number of <hi>Gods</hi> Elect. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> ≈øaith,<note place="margin">Pro. 27.19</note>

The fir≈øt marke whereby we may know whether we be elect or not, is the inward te≈øtimony and witne≈ø≈øe of Gods ≈øpirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15</note> 
                        <hi>Yee haue not receiued the ≈øpirit of bondage to feare againe; but ye haue, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells vs, that wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ≈øinners, which haue not the ≈øpirit of God to guide them, but liue in ≈øinne; they haue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the ≈øpirit of Bondage, they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:183907:55"/> haue no tru peace in their ≈øouls: but they that be the children of God, haue the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ≈øeales vnto our harts the a≈ø≈øurance of our adoption, and election, and doth make it knowne vnto vs, that we are the Sonnes of God: <hi>For his Spirit doth witne≈ø≈øe to our ≈øpirits, that we are the Sonnes of God, Romans</hi> 8.16.</p>
                     <p>And, that no man might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him≈øelfe, and thinke hee hath the te≈øtimonie of GODS Spirit, when hee hath it not: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth vs two mo≈øt excellent notes, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee haue the te≈øtimonie of GODS Spirit, yea, or not. It maketh vs crie, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> Where the Spirit of God doth witne≈ø≈øe to any mans ≈øoule that hee is the childe of God; It will make him cry to God, and euen
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:183907:56"/> fill heauen and earth, with cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and teares, with ≈øobbes and ≈øighes for the pardon of his ≈øins. And hee which hath not this in him, that hee cannot crie vnto GOD for pardon of his ≈øinnes; this man can not truely a≈ø≈øure him≈øelfe that hee is the Childe of God. And though men ≈øay, they hope to be ≈øaued, yet (alas) they ≈øeldome or neuer pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for the pardon of their ≈øinnes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if wee finde the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony of GODS Spirit, that wee are the children of God; It will make vs, not onely, to bee earne≈øt with God for pardon of our ≈øinnes, but it will make vs cry, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> that is, it will make vs beare the tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a duetifull childe, ≈øo as we ≈øhall be afraide to offend ≈øo louing a Father. And therefore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:183907:56"/> all tho≈øe which delight in ≈øinne, and are not afrayde to offend GOD: Surely, they can find no a≈ø≈øurance, that they be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. And therefore, if you de≈øire to be a≈ø≈øured that the names be in this Booke; labour to finde this te≈øtimony of Gods Spirit, to witne≈ø≈øe vnto your Soules, that you belong vnto God, and labour to be earne≈øt in prayer vnto God, for that is a ≈øpeciall worke of Gods Spirit.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.12</note> The ≈øecond means whereby we may know, whether our names be written in the Booke of <hi>Life;</hi> is by the word of GOD. For, the word of God tells vs, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer beleeueth in Chri≈øt Ie≈øu, ≈øhall be ≈øaued. But the childe of God hearing this promi≈øe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and applied, by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterie of Gods word, is able to ≈øay, I beleeue; and am able to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:183907:57"/> apply this promi≈øe to my ≈øelfe: For no man hath faith, but hee knoweth that hee hath it, and therefore can ≈øay, ≈øeeing I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue with all my heart, ≈øurely I know I ≈øhall be ≈øaued.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, be≈øides the ble≈ø≈øed te≈øtimony of Gods Spirit, which cannot deceiue, and the witnes of the word of GOD; wee may know our election by the fruits, and effects thereof. As wee ≈øay a man is aliue, ≈øo long as we ≈øee him breathe; and can iudge of the Tree by the fruits: Euen ≈øo, by the effects of Election, wee may know whether our names be in the Booke of Life, or not. Now the fruites of Election bee ≈øet downe by the Holie-Gho≈øt, that al men might be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and try them≈øelues, and know whether they bee orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Life, or not: <hi>Whom GOD
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:183907:57"/> prede≈øtinated,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.30</note> 
                        <hi>them al≈øo hee Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and whom he Called, them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo he Iu≈øtified, and whom hee Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtified, them al≈øo he Glorified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where we may beholde the markes of our Election. For all that be elected to Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and bee written in this Booke; they are fir≈øt called; ≈øecondly iu≈øtified; and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ≈øanctified. So then, if you would know whether you bee elected to life, looke to the≈øe three effects of Election. Art thou Called? art thou Iu≈øtified? art thou ≈øanctified? Then ≈øure thou art Elected: But if thou ha≈øt not the≈øe three, then can≈øt thou not a≈ø≈øure thy ≈øelfe of thy ≈øaluation.</p>
                     <p>So then, the fir≈øt fruite of our Election is our effectuall Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when as God doth, by the Preaching of the Go≈øpell, call
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:183907:58"/> vs out of the world; from our olde ≈øinnes, to be of the number of his people, to liue as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Againe, when a man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the preaching of the Word, to ≈øee his ≈øinnes, and Gods anger for them; di≈ølikes them, is grieued for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailes them, and begs the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for them, and beginnes to become a new man; to beleeue in Chri≈øt Ie≈øu, to ≈øeeke after Gods Kingdome: Hee which findeth this effectuall calling in him, he may a≈ø≈øure his Soule, that hee is Prede≈øtinated to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life. But wee mu≈øt take heed that wee deceiue not our ≈øelues with an outward calling, for our Sauiour ≈øaith;<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Many are called, but few are cho≈øen.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe heare the word of God with the eare: but wee mu≈øt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to finde the Spirit of God
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:183907:58"/> to preach vnto our Soules; to applie the Word to our con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to beleeue it, and to obey it. And therefore, they which liue in their old ≈øinnes, as blind, ignorant, and prophane, as euer before; (alas) how can they thinke to be ≈øaued? ≈øeeing God choo≈øes none, or ≈øaues not any, but whom he calles effectually by the Go≈øpel,<note place="margin">2 The≈ø≈ø. 2.13.</note> and ≈øeuers from the re≈øt of the world.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the fruit of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is Iu≈øtification: <hi>For whom he prede≈øtinated, them hee called:</hi> So then heere is an other token and marke, to know whether we be Elected, namely, or Iu≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Now, this is an e≈øpeciall grace of God, to iu≈øtifie a poore ≈øinner that mu≈øt be ≈øaued. And who≈øoeuer is not iu≈øtified, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øaued. Iu≈øtification hath two parts. Fir≈øt, the pardon of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:183907:59"/> ≈øinne: ≈øecondly, the imputation of Chri≈øts righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe; For that, before a man can be iu≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, hee mu≈øt repent him of his ≈øinnes, know them, hate them, and begge the pardon of them; and then Chri≈øt Ie≈øus will a≈ø≈øure vs of the pardon of them. And therefore, if wee would know whether we be iu≈øtified, or not, we mu≈øt looke whether we haue truely repented, yea and haue beene truely humbled for our ≈øinnes, and got the pardon of them all. Secondly, that wee may bee truely iu≈øtified, wee mu≈øt haue a true faith in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus; to lay hold vpon him, to be per≈øwaded and a≈ø≈øured in our ≈øoules, that Chri≈øt died for me, ≈øhed his Bloud for me, obeyed the Law for me, and will couer all my ≈øinnes in his Righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. So then, marke the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:183907:59"/> where there is repentance, there is Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes; where there is remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, there is iu≈øtification; and where there is iu≈øtification, there is ≈øaluation. And on the contrarie parts; where there is no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there is no remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes; where there is no remi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of ≈øinnes, there is no iu≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and where there is no iu≈øtification, there is no ≈øalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O then what ≈øhall become of tho≈øe that liue in ≈øin, delight in ≈øin, and neuer (as yet) could ≈øhed one teare for their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and grieuous ≈øinnes? They can not finde them≈øelues to bee iu≈øtified; they can haue no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their ≈øinnes, ≈øo long as they liue in ≈øin. And therefore if you would knovv vvhether you ≈øhall be ≈øaued, or not: la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour fir≈øt of all to repent, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:183907:60"/> to lay hold on Chri≈øt by Fayth, that ≈øo he may couer your ≈øins in his Bloud.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, fruite of Election is ≈øanctified. And this is a ≈øpeciall marke of Gods childe,<note place="margin">2 The. 2.13</note> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, to be ≈øanctified. Now Sanctification ≈øtandeth in two parts: fir≈øt, they mu≈øt dye vnto ≈øinne: ≈øecondly, they mu≈øt ri≈øe to righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe. And would you know then a≈ø≈øuredly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your names are written in the Booke of Life? Looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ≈øoules. If you finde that you are ≈øanctified, if you hate your olde ≈øinnes, and filthie wayes; if you loue Vertues, and delight in all holy dueties; then it is a certaine token that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto God.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> For there is no condemnation to them that are in Chri≈øt. But if you do ≈øauour the things of the fle≈øh; lying in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:183907:60"/> the old ≈øins, Drunkenne≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. why then certainely, you haue no a≈ø≈øurance of ≈øaluation, that you can be ≈øaued: But you mu≈øt needes ≈øing this dolefull Song, I know not what ≈øhall become of my poore Soule, whether I ≈øhall be ≈øaued or damned. Nay, if thou liue in ≈øinne, thou mai≈øt iu≈øtly feare that thou art a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of hell: For, <hi>Hee that is borne of God, ≈øinneth not:</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18. And, <hi>Let euery one that calles on the name of the Lord, depart from iniquity,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Thus to die to ≈øin, and to liue to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈ønes, is a ≈øure token that wee belong to God. Thus you ≈øee, how a man may come to know, whether hee be elected, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to Life, or not. Now let vs ≈øee what v≈øe ari≈øeth hence.</p>
                     <p>Seeing God hath his Booke <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">V≈øe </seg>1</label> of Life, in which be written the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:183907:61"/> names of all tho≈øe that ≈øhall bee ≈øaued, and none of them ≈øhall peri≈øh: hence cometh endle≈ø≈øe comfort to all Gods children: If thou finde that thou art the childe of God, and thy name is written in Heauen, nothing can hurt thee, though thou bee poore, ≈øicke, full of ≈øores, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, hated, contemned; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hurt thee. Nay, all the gates of Hell can not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile again≈øt thee: no damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can come vnto thee. For if God do iu≈øtifie, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne? for at the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chri≈øt Ie≈øus will take his Booke of Life, and call vs, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Come yee ble≈ø≈øed:</hi> So as we ≈øhall not come to a terrible Iudgement, but to a louing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ≈øeeing that it is ≈øo excellent a thing to haue our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:183907:61"/> names written in this Booke; to be the Elect childe of God; we ≈øhould labour for this aboue all things in the world; for without this, wee can haue no ≈øound comfort, either in life or death. And therefore our Sauior bids vs in the tenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> not to boa≈øt our ≈øelues of Learning, of Wi≈øedome, of Riches: whereas the≈øe are but vaine things; but to reioyce that our names bee written in heauen.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ≈øeeing God hath a Booke of Life, and hath written downe the very names of euery man and woman, that ≈øhall be ≈øaued; and hath withall ≈øhewed vs the way that leads vnto Life; and vnle≈ø≈øe we walk in this way, we can not come vnto it: It is our wi≈øedome to walke in the way that leades to Life, in the practi≈øe of Godline≈ø≈øe. VVee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:183907:62"/> are Ve≈ø≈øelles of Honour, and therefore mu≈øt liue ≈øoberly, iu≈øtly, and godly, in this pre≈øent world. Not to ≈øerue ≈øinne, and Sathan any longer: But as the redeemed of the Lord, to walke from ≈øtrength to ≈øtrength, from vertue to vertue, from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection to an other: till at length wee appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and there to reape the happie revvard; euen the ful fruition of all happine≈ø≈øe, and that for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

But Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øaith heere, that euen the dead mu≈øt come to iudgement; euen their olde ≈øinnes mu≈øt come to light, and they mu≈øt an≈øwer for them.

                  <p>And marke this difference, The children of God haue two re≈øurrections, and one death: they ri≈øe from ≈øinne in this life, to newne≈ø≈øe and holine≈ø≈øe of

And as they neuer had part in the fir≈øt re≈øurrection: ≈øo the ≈øecond re≈øurrection is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to iudgement, to death, and to damnation.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, if you would liue when you bee dead, you mu≈øt die to ≈øin whiles you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue.

                     <p>By this you may alittle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:183907:108"/> the extreamitie of this wofull Lake of hel fire. But if I had the tongue of men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, I could neuer expre≈ø≈øe it to the full. For as the ioyes of heauen be vn≈øpeakeable, ≈øo the torments of hell can not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed, at what time the totall wrath of God ≈øhall ≈øeize vppon the reprobates, both body and ≈øoule, and ≈øhall feed vpon them for euermore. Now, to the end you may the better conceiue the extreamitie of it, you mu≈øt know, that the torments of hel, they be vniuer≈øal euen in all the parts of the bodie, and faculties of the ≈øoule at once; the mind, the wil, the con≈øcience, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the head, the heart, &amp;c. all at once ≈øhall be tormented. The paines in this life, they are (for the mo≈øt part) particular in ≈øome part of the body: but in

Alas, what a woefull thing will this be, to be thus tormented, euen in all and euerie member ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly? Let one example ≈øerue in this point. The rich Glutton cries out, <hi>Oh I am tormented in this flame! Luk.</hi> 16. The torment and heate was ≈øo great, that hee would haue giuen euen a whole world, if he had beene Lord of it, for ≈øo much water as would haue ≈øtucke to ones finger, to haue cooled his flaming tong: Tongue, tongue; Soule, ≈øoule: Thus you ≈øee, that this fire is mo≈øt extreame and wofull, and yet men wil not beleeue it, they feare it not.</p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:183907:109"/>
                     <p>But let vs thinke vppon the mo≈øt wofull and extreme paine of this Lake of fire, and let vs make that v≈øe which CHRIST teacheth vs: <hi>If thy right hand or foote,</hi> that is, anie thing neuer ≈øo ≈øweete, neuer ≈øo profitable, neuer ≈øo deere or neere vnto vs; <hi>Let vs cut them off and ca≈øt them from vs;</hi> that is, let vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, and for≈øake them all: For it is better to goe poore to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then rich to hell: It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to goe naked to Heauen, then in co≈øtly apparell to Hell. O let all carnall men, all vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øinners, that liue in plea≈øures, ≈øports or pa≈øtimes; yea let them know they ≈øhall pay full deerely for the≈øe things, euen the lo≈ø≈øe of their ≈øoules in hell for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as the paines of Hell be ea≈øele≈ø≈øe and mo≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:183907:109"/> ≈øo they be endle≈ø≈øe and perpetuall, no end of them for euermore. So <hi>Abraham</hi> tels the rich Glutton; <hi>You that bee there cannot come hither, Luke</hi> 16. and ≈øo ≈øayth S. <hi>Iohn, Reuel.</hi> 21. <hi>It is a lake of fire &amp; brim≈øtone that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for euer.</hi> So, <hi>Go ye cur≈øed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerla≈øting fire, Mat.</hi> 25.41. It can neuer be quenched, when as damned ≈øinners ≈øhal lie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many thou≈øand yeares, yea, as many as there be Starres in Heauen, and yet neuer to haue an end. If a man ≈øhould but once euerie thou≈øand yeares, take one ≈øpoonfull of water out of the Sea; how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand thou≈øand yeares would be expired before he ≈øhould haue emptied the ≈øame?</p>
                     <p>O con≈øider this, you that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get GOD; Con≈øider this, you which contemne the Word of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:183907:110"/> GOD, profane the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, that make no con≈øcience at all of drunkenne≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. what a trea≈øure of plagues the Lord hath re≈øerued for the damned? Oh, let vs thinke often of this, that the≈øe torments bee both endle≈ø≈øe and ea≈øele≈ø≈øe? Oh what madde men and women, what fooles be wee, if wee will now enioy the plea≈øures of ≈øinne for a ≈øea≈øon, and then to lie in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for euer? What ≈øhall it benefite or profite vs to enioy a litle worldly pelfe, mony, lands or liuings heere, to liue in all plea≈øures &amp; delights, ≈øome ≈øix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or eightie yeares, and then to be tormented in hell fire for euermore. And yet doe we ≈øee that ≈øuch is the extreame follie, and madnes of many men, that they will haue their penyworths heere, though they pay neuer
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:183907:110"/> ≈øo deare for it in the life which is to come.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the≈øe torments, as they be endle≈ø≈øe and ea≈øele≈ø≈øe, ≈øo they be remedile≈ø≈øe. This we may beholde in the Glutton in hell, who would haue giuen a world, if hee had beene owner of it, and yet for all that could he not haue it; it was then deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. For there is no ea≈øe nor remedy: in hell no redemption after death; no ≈øiluer nor golde, no witte, nor policie, no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to another Iudge; but hee mu≈øt lie by it for euermore euen in this clo≈øe pri≈øon, till he haue paid the debt and vttermo≈øt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For, if all the Saints and Angells in the Kingdome of heauen ≈øhould fall at the feete of Chri≈øt, to begge but for one ≈øoule, it could do him no good, CHRIST would deny them al,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:183907:111"/> they mu≈øt haue the repul≈øe.</p>
                     <p>O con≈øider this: this is it that ought to make all men to quake, and all hearts to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in hell is no ea≈øe, nor hope of redemption. This is that which makes the deuils and damned ≈øpirits to feare and to tremble, and yet it cannot moue flintie, and ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie-hearted ≈øinners once to be afraid. O I be≈øeech you let vs thinke of the≈øe things now in the≈øe daies of mercie: now is remedie to bee had, now wee may auoide this woefull mi≈øerie, now wee may e≈øcape this fearefull torment. If wee will now repent, if we will now leaue our ≈øinnes and begge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of almighty God for them, we may e≈øcape: but after death there is no time of mercie but iudgement and torment,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:183907:111"/> but fire, and brim≈øtone, and the wrath of God for euermore. And therefore now let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, let vs bewaile our ≈øinnes, and liue as the ≈øeruants of God, and not as the ≈ølaues of ≈øinne and Sathan, any longer; and then the gates of hell ≈øhall not preuaile again≈øt vs.</p>
                     <p>Our Sauiour Chri≈øt tels vs,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.26</note> that the ≈øoule of a poore begger is more worth then many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand worlds: And therefore the lo≈ø≈øe of a ≈øoule is greater then the lo≈ø≈øe of the whole world.</p>
                     <p>If a man ≈øhould loo≈øe Hou≈øe, Land, Wife, Childe, and all hee hath, yet it is nothing in compari≈øon of his ≈øoule: that is a lo≈ø≈øe of all lo≈ø≈øes, to bee ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from God, and from Chri≈øt, and to bee in hell torments for euer. O then let vs know what our ≈øoules bee worth; let vs
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:183907:112"/> learne to prize them aboue the whole world. But alas, men can not ≈øo e≈øteeme of them. Oh no: men will for one penny, or an houres plea≈øure, hazard lo≈ø≈øe of ≈øoule and bodie for euermore. Ah poore ≈øoule, thou did≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet know what thy ≈øoule is worth. Chri≈øt Ie≈øus ≈øayth, it is more worth then all the world. Oh let vs ≈øo e≈øteeme of it, and value it, and account all riches, plea≈øures, or profites, as dung, ≈øo that our ≈øoules, our poore ≈øoules may be ≈øaued in the day of our Lord.</p>
